## Low Budget Youtube

This Project is part of the multiple projects I plan to build in the next 30 days to practice and showcase my **React Js** skills.
This is a documentation of my daily approach to the problem.

Started - December 1st 2020

  ###### Day1-Day3
  
  **Completed HomePage and Trending page components**
  
  I initialised my project setup using create-react-app of course.
  I went on  to use a [color picker](https://imagecolorpicker.com/en/) to get all color codes used on the website.
  Then to the building of the containers and components, from the look of the website(youtube), I can see that it's divided into 3 containers - Header, Side Bar, and the Main container. I coded those up together with their components and tested it using data from [Youtube  API](https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/docs).
  Yeah, for the icons I used [Material Ui](https://material-ui.com/).
